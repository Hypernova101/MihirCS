    "# Significant Feature Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the enemies group, we decided to make our significant feature enhancement a Final Boss level that will come after all levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog shows how we incorporated JavaScript Objects, Finite State Machines, and Single Responsibility Principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# JavaScript Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, what is a JavaScript Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "To our knowledge, a JavaScript object is an object that has a collection of properties. These are referenced using key:value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our boss level (and the whole game altogether), JavaScript objects get utilized quite frequently. They're used in enemies, players, game elements, and so much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see this when everything gets called to instantiate the level in GameSetup.js\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "{ name: 'boss', id: 'boss', class: Boss, data: this.assets.enemies.boss, xPercentage: 0.5, minPosition: 0.3 },\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we are creating an object with multiple properties. Let's go step by step and see what each of them do.\n",
    "\n",
    " - name: human readable name for the object that shows up on the display\n",
    " - id: identifier used within the code of the game\n",
    " - class: defines behavior of the object (so how the boss enemy functions)\n",
    " - data: the actual spritesheet of the boss enemy\n",
    " - Xpercentage: horizontal position of object relative to canvas size\n",
    " - minPosition: minimum horizontal position the boss can move to (0.3 in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we can see the importance of JavaScript objects within JS code and how it gets used to boil down a complex object to make everything more centralized and easier to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finite State Machines\n",
    "As per our understanding, a Finite State Machine (FSM) is a machine that can only be in one state out of a finite number of states. Without the fluff, all this means is that it can only be in one state at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used this when defining different rows and columns for our sprites when they were in different states. Using our Random Event, the Boss has to be in 1 of 7 states (finite number of states). \n",
    "\n",
    "Those were:\n",
    " - idleL\n",
    " - idleR\n",
    " - left\n",
    " - right\n",
    " - attackL\n",
    " - attackR\n",
    " - death\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these states had rows and columns assigned to them as per our spritesheet. These were all defined in GameSetup.js as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "boss: {\n",
    "\tsrc: \"/images/platformer/sprites/boss.png\",\n",
    "\twidth: 64,\n",
    "\theight: 64,\n",
    "\tscaleSize: 320,\n",
    "\tspeedRatio: 0.2,\n",
    "\tanimationSpeed: 6,\n",
    "\tidleL: { row: 9, frames: 0, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } },\n",
    "\tidleR: { row: 11, frames: 0, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } },\n",
    "\tleft: { row: 9, frames: 8, idleFrame: { column: 7, frames: 0 } },\n",
    "\tright: { row: 11, frames: 8, idleFrame: { column: 7, frames: 0 } },\n",
    "\tattackL: { row: 13, frames: 5 },\n",
    "\tattackR: { row: 15, frames: 5 },\n",
    "\tdeath: { row: 20, frames: 5 },\n",
    "},\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state here has a specific action attached to it. For example, the idleR state has the following:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "{ row: 11, frames: 0, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } },\n",
    "```\n",
    "This indicates the action for each state. The states for the boss get called in Boss.js where all the actions and behaviors for the Boss are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it checks whether the state is dead or not and assigns accordingly.\n",
    "```js\n",
    "updateFrameX() {\n",
    "// Update animation frameX of the object\n",
    "\tif(!this.death  ||  this.state.animation  !=  \"death\"){\n",
    "\t\tif (this.frameX  <  this.maxFrame) {\n",
    "\t\t\tif(this.counter  >  0){\n",

    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then check for the other states in the randomEvent method still in Boss.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "randomEvent(){\n",
    "\tif (GameControl.randomEventId  ===  1  &&  GameControl.randomEventState  ===  2){ //event: stop the zombie\n",
    "\t\tthis.state.direction  =  \"left\";\n",

    "\t\tGameControl.endRandomEvent();\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, it can only have one state, and when each state gets called / assigned, a new action occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "This is the principle that every function, every method should have only one function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very low-level anatomy of Boss.js includes 5 functions; \n",
    " - updateFrameX()\n",
    " - updateMovement()\n",
    " - randomEvent()\n",
    " - update()\n",
    " - collisionAction()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for obvious reasons, I won't put the whole Boss.js code for space reasons, but the point remains that many files within the repository are coded with multiple functions, all serving one individual purpose, that are combined together to demonstrate the behaviors of the main item.\n",

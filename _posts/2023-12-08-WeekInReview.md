<p style="color:white;">I started off this week by aiming to complete the partner posts, expirement with JavaScript animations, improve the overall look of my website, and try to get at least 50% done with the snake game, which I think I have achieved. My partner, Ansh, and I finished the barebones of the partner posts pretty quickly, but to have fun, Ansh came up with the idea of animating our posts, which I really liked, so we both animated our own posts on each other's website. Next, I changed the banner color of my website to make it more aesthetically pleasing for me, and I defined many functions within the CSS file to add gradients to my headers. All of so, of course, with my partner, Ansh's help. Finally, yesterday, after we were happy with the website and posts, we started to work on the snake game, which we have definitely gone past 50% completion, maybe even 80%. All in all, I'd say that this was a pretty productive week in terms of expirementing and learning.</p>
